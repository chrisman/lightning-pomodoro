# Pomodoro

I can't get this talk shorter than 10 minutes or longer than two D:

## Intro

* Pomodoro is a time management technique where you set a timer for 25 minutes and work as diligently as you can, and then take a five minute break. It lets you work distraction-free for a period of time, and then rest, so you can stay fresh and continue to work productively.

* I'm going to talk about the idea behind it, WHY it works, and then why it's well suited to the kind of learning we're doing here at FULL STACK.

## WHY IT WORKS

* __time traveling:__ We're all time experiencers. There are two ways to talk about, experience, and think about time.

  1. Sequencing. This is an intuitive way of thinking about time that we're all able to grasp by time we enter Kindergarten. Q) What'd you do today? A) Woke up, brushed my teeth, ate breakfast, got dressed, went to school, came home, played, ate dinner, did my homework, went to bed.

  2. _Becoming._ This is the way we've learned to think of time as adults. It's the notion of hours and minutes, the idea that time happens to us, flows past us, and is something that we need to keep up with. It's this idea that allows us to say things like, "It's been 2.5 days and I'm still not done with Tip Calculator."

* So make a choice. Pomodoro is a _sequencing tool_ that lets you break something absurdly vast like "Learning Javascript" into something no more intimidating than "wake up, brush your teeth, eat breakfast, get dressed..."

## WELL SUITED

* __set the stage.__ Day 1, we were given a framework for _Learning To Learn_. Step one was SET THE STAGE, which goes something like this.

  1. Clear the stage: set up an environment where you don't have to worry about forgetting something. Get a timer. Get a pencil and paper. Get cranking on code. Every thing that comes up, jot it down and then keep cranking.

    * You got a text message? Make a note and keep cranking.

    * Remembered about an article you want to read? Make a note and keep cranking.

    Pomodoro is a great way to keep your mind clear and focused. That stuff will be waiting for you when you're done.

  2. Process over product.

    * The unknown is scary. When I open up a new homework assignment, I think to myself, "Whelp. I might be doing this until 2AM." And that's intimidating.

    * Instead, plan on doing 2 pomodoros, and have completing them be the goal.
